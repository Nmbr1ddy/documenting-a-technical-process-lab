# Setting up a Virtual Machine (VM)
In this lab we'll be setting up a VM to safely run programs designed for an old Operating System (OS). You will need ample space and an internet connection, We will need to downlaod some programs to get started. 
1. You will need to download VitualBox or a similar system.
2. You will need a copy of the OS drive you will be using. Dowload it for use later. 
- Examples of OS are Windows 10, Windows XP, or Newer but seperate OS such as Linux.
3. Open vitual box and "create new".
4. Follow all on screen prompts giving all need space and memory.
- Look up your OS's requirments and remember to add additional space and memory for additional programs.
- Most of these decisions can be adjusted later so don't worry if you get them wrong.
5. Open the new VM 
6. After setup you will be prompted to insert driver. 
- Check the recently dowloaded if you can't remeber where you saved it.
7. The system may reboot and then open.
- If it takes more than 30 mins, delete the VM and start over with more RAM and more CPU's

You can now run your new virtual computer. Setting while your VM is down will help you make adjustments after the fact.
